The script was prepared for the statistical analysis of the data collected from the online survey, with the aim to explore the Cypriot perceptions regarding climate-related health risks in 2018 and 2021. The tables in SI and MS do not appear in the order they appear in the output and in some cases the output tables were merged.

#Go back to the dataset q_EN_GR_clean1a about questionnaires of 2021 (both greek and english).

#Here we will deal with health assessment part using the Short-Form (SF) 36 Health Survey. 
#We used seven out of the eight concepts/scales of the survey (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, social functioning, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being and general health perceptions), to describe the self-assessed health status of the participants and the question on perceived change in health. The range of the scores for these scales is by 0 and 100, with a higher score indicating a more favourable health state for all scales, except the health change scale. The health change scale, which is comprised of only one item, shows the perceived difference by the current health status and the health status one year before, with a higher score indicating that the current health status is perceived as better compared to the previous yearâ€™s health status
